        <div class="body2">Karl Gerstner (1930–2017) was a Swiss designer, typographer, author, and artist. He was a leading representative of Swiss typography and one of the most important innovators of typography, advertising graphics and corporate design.

          <b>Subject:</b> <br>
          The exhibition’s title means “inventing rules for arrangement” and is a didactic presentation of a mode of observing and creating systematically upon visual reality. It documents Karl Gerstner's design methodology: using a rule set or system defined by the designer that would determine all aesthetic decisions for a given product.
          <br>
          <br>
          <p><b>Context:</b> <br>
          Gerstner defines design as picking out determining elements and combining them. Much of his design theory hinges on the designer’s ability to make informed choices based on understanding of the problem and the combinations of elements. To come to a problem’s solution, the designer must be able to describe and understand the problem. By then developing a set of intellectual criteria, the designer is able to make ‘creative decisions’ which are based on a systematic approach instead of instinct.</p>
          The set of ‘intellectual criteria’ that Gerstner speaks about can also be seen as a set of consciously derived parameters which directly address the problem the designer has identified. These parameters can then be used to work through the problem to find a solution which is a combination of the determining elements which convey the intended message. For Gerstner, these criteria took the form of a systematic set of rules or parameters which he referred to as a programme.

          <b>Observation:</b> <br>
          I think this publication ties closely with what we’ve learned in this class: presenting designs through computing. In the current world, powerful computer systems include so many elements that are already grouped in a way that allows us to navigate our choices easily. We have been using this system through digital designing; our design experience is made easier by programs like Adobe. It’s fascinating how Gerstner was able to find commonalities in problems and derive a universal way of creating a set of rules that give solutions to different problems despite the time period he was in.

          <br>
          <b>Lesson:</b> <br>
          • Breaking down design problems into different elements<br>
          • How to find solutions effectively through a set of rules instead of trial-and-error
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Questions:</b> <br>
          How would you describe the process of coding as a system? <br>
          Does anyone have their own set of rules or courses when designing?
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Connection:</b> <br>
          I think this method of solving problems can be used in our typography class.<br>
          - Choosing a typeface
          - Deciding the style and weight
          - Grid system
